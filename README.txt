This is representative of what the website for Bucknell Alpha Phi Omega - Iota Kappa Chapter could look like. Each of the sections is filled with placeholder content where applicable (pictures and textboxes) but in places where content is yet to be available (the Calendar or Upcoming Events, as well as the Blog, and other sections) this will be updated when the fraternity is fully up and running in the Fall Semester. This is a very rough draft of what could eventually be very different from this. 

* The Blog section, when content is available for it, will contain a possibly weekly blog entry, with a navigation panel on the left side for quick access to each week's entry. 
* The Calendar section will show, in typical calendar view, the various community service events as well as internal fraternity meetings that members should attend.
* The About section will be updated when the fraternity is officially active, and will likely contain contact information of each of the officers, as well as information about the national fraternity itself and the community service events in which we have participated in the past.
* The Members section will, upon login, bring that member to their designated page, where information about their registered community service hours, dues paid, blog posts made, and other information will be visible to that member. This is, of course, not implemented yet as this is a rough draft, but that is to come in the future.
